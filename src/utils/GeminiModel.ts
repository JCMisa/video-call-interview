  "feedback": "Ian, thanks for sharing your answers! While your response gives a basic understanding of your interests and preferences, it could be improved with more detail and clarity. For example, you mention liking math but don't explain *why* you enjoy it. Similarly, you state a preference for modular learning and studying alone, but it would be beneficial to explain *how* these methods help you learn best. The answer about extracurricular activities is a little vague â€“ specifying which sports you enjoy would make your answer stronger. Finally, elaborating on what 'reasonable expectations' means in your family would provide a more complete picture.",
  "rating": 5,
  "suggestions": "<h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>\\n<ul>\\n  <li><b>Favorite Subject (Math):</b> Instead of just saying you like math, explain *why*. Is it the problem-solving aspect? The logical thinking? Give a specific example of something you enjoyed learning in math. For instance:  <i>\\"My favorite subject is math because I enjoy the challenge of problem-solving. I particularly liked learning about trigonometry because it helped me understand how angles and distances are related.\\"</i></li>\\n  <li><b>Learning Method (Modular):</b> Expand on why you prefer modular learning. What benefits does it offer *you*? How does it help you learn? For example: <i>\\"I find the modular learning method most effective because it allows me to learn at my own pace and focus on areas where I need more help. Being able to study the materials independently helps me absorb the information better.\\"</i></li>\\n  <li><b>Study Preference (Alone):</b> Explain why you prefer studying alone. Is it because you concentrate better? Or do you like to set your own schedule? For example: <i>\\"I prefer to study alone because I can concentrate better without distractions. It also allows me to set my own schedule and focus on the areas where I need the most work.\\"</i></li>\\n  <li><b>Extracurricular Activity (Sports):</b> Be specific! Which sports interest you? Why? What skills do you hope to gain from participating? For example: <i>\\"I'm most interested in basketball and volleyball. I enjoy the teamwork and physical activity involved. I hope to improve my coordination and learn better teamwork skills.\\"</i></li>\\n  <li><b>Motivation for Extracurriculars:</b> You mentioned enhancing skills. Be specific! Which skills? What else motivates you? Is it about making friends, staying active, or learning new things? For example: <i>\\"I participate in extracurricular activities to enhance my leadership and teamwork skills. I also enjoy meeting new people and trying new things. It's a great way to stay active and learn outside of the classroom.\\"</i></li>\\n  <li><b>Family Expectations:</b> Instead of just saying \\"reasonable expectations, focus on effort,\\" give a specific example of what that means to you and your family. For example: <i>\\"My family expects me to put in my best effort and strive for improvement, even if I don't always get perfect grades. They value hard work and dedication above all else.\\"</i></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Remember to speak clearly and confidently in your interview, and provide detailed answers. Good luck!</p>"
